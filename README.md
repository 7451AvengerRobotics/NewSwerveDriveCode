Getting ready for the 2026 FRC game, this is our preseason code! This repository programs an advanced chassis with multiple features:

  - Swerve Drivetrain: Still a four wheel drivetrain, this has four drive motors for positional movement on the field and four steering motors for turning the robot. These two systems are separate from one another (they are different motors), which enables for more flexible and swift driving.
  - Field Relative Drive: When pushing the joystick forward, rather than moving the robot forward relative to the robot itself, the robot moves forward along the field. This is especially important on swerve drives, as they have enhanced mobility angularly, and this will simplify driving. As you turn the robot, the forward on the robot relative to the robot changes, and being field relative keeps forward constant for you, the driver
  - Vision: The robot uses a vision system to detect field targets. By viewing AprilTags on the field, it uses them to determine its own position on the field. This allows the robot to know exactly where it is, which improves driving accuracy and supports other systems like autonomous routines and alignment.
  - Autonomous Driving: Pre-programmed routines allow the robot to operate without driver input during the autonomous period. These routines use a combination of sensors, odometry, and field-relative control to navigate the field efficiently. Paths can be followed precisely, enabling scoring, positioning, or interacting with field elements automatically.
  - Auto Alignment: Works with the vision system to orient the robot perfectly toward a target. Once a goal is detected, the robot can adjust its position and rotation automatically, ensuring placement for scoring or game interactions. This reduces driver workload and increases accuracy during the match.

This program uses the AdvantageKit TalonFX swerve template, Photonvision, and PathPlanner. This program almost completely covers the robot driving mechanism, giving more time for the programming team to develop subsystem code, advanced paths, and finer tuning of the system's movement.
